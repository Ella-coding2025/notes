# Notes about Python

Here are some notes from my Tuft's Coding Academy

### If/Else (Boolean logic)

Let's talk about Boolean logic! Some keywords that you should know:
* **if**: check a condition (you always have one `if`)
* **elif**: check a subsequent condition (you can have 0 or more)
* **else**: run if none of the above conditions apply (you can have 0 or 1 `else` statements in an `if` control structure)

```python
weather = 78 # fahrenheit
if weather < 40:
  print("bring winter jacket)
elif weather < 60:
  print("bring light jacket")
else:
  print("nno jacket needed!")
```
